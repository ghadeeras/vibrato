# Vibrato.js
![ci-js-build](https://github.com/ghadeeras/vibrato/workflows/ci-js-build/badge.svg)

Much like the [Vibrato](../README.md) project targets the Java programming language, this is a similar digital signal processing library (or a computation library) for the JavaScript or TypeScript programming languages. The concept is a little different though. Vibrato.js is meant to be like an intermediate representation (IR) for a minimal functional DSP language that compiles to a WebAssembly module, which then can be referenced by a JavaScript module.

The project is still in its infancy. It will take a while before it reaches the stage of a viable product. So again, please bear with me :-)
