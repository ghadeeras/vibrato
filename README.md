# Vibrato
Vibrato is a technique that musicians (specially of string instruments) use to produce beautiful sounds from their 
instruments :-) ... But in the context of this project, Vibrato is an awesome (or soon to be so) digital signal 
processing framework for the Java programing language.

It is still in a very early stage of the development process. So bear with me please :-)

Explore the various packages that comprise the project:
 * [`vibrato.complex`](src/main/java/vibrato/complex/ComplexNumbers.md)
 * [`vibrato.fourier`](src/main/java/vibrato/fourier/FourierTransforms.md)
 * [`vibrato.functions`](src/main/java/vibrato/functions/Functions.md)
